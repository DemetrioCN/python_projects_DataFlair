### Basic to Advanced projects in Python


### BASIC

#### Number Guessing
Python Project Idea – Make a program which randomly chooses a number to guess and then the user will have a few chances to guess the number correctly. In each wrong attempt, the computer will give a hint that the number is greater or smaller than the one you have guessed.

#### Dice Rolling Simulator in Python
The dice rolling simulator will imitate the experience of rolling a dice. It will generate a random number and the user can play again and again to get a number from the dice until the user decides to quit the program.

#### Email Slicer
Python Project Idea – The email slicer is a handy program to get the username and domain name from an email address. You can customize and send a message to the user with this information.

#### Binary Search Algorithm
The binary search algorithm is a very effective way to search for an element in a long list. The idea is to implement the algorithm that searches for an element in a list.

#### Desktop Notifier App
A desktop notifier app runs on your system and it will be used to send you notifications after every specific interval of time. You can use the libraries like notify2, requests, etc to build this app.

#### Python Story Generator
The project will randomly create stories with a little bit of customizations. You can ask users to input a few words like name, action, etc and then it will modify the stories using your words.

#### Youtube Videos Downloader
Another interesting project is to make a nice interface through which you can download youtube videos in different formats and video quality.

#### Python Website Blocker
Build an application that can be used to block certain websites from opening. This is a very helpful program for students who want to focus on studies and don’t want any other distractions like social media.
