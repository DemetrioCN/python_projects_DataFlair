### Basic to Advanced projects in Python


### BASIC

#### Number Guessing
Python Project Idea – Make a program which randomly chooses a number to guess and then the user will have a few chances to guess the number correctly. In each wrong attempt, the computer will give a hint that the number is greater or smaller than the one you have guessed.

#### Dice Rolling Simulator in Python
The dice rolling simulator will imitate the experience of rolling a dice. It will generate a random number and the user can play again and again to get a number from the dice until the user decides to quit the program.

#### Email Slicer
Python Project Idea – The email slicer is a handy program to get the username and domain name from an email address. You can customize and send a message to the user with this information.

#### Binary Search Algorithm
The binary search algorithm is a very effective way to search for an element in a long list. The idea is to implement the algorithm that searches for an element in a list.

#### Desktop Notifier App
A desktop notifier app runs on your system and it will be used to send you notifications after every specific interval of time. You can use the libraries like notify2, requests, etc to build this app.

#### Python Story Generator
The project will randomly create stories with a little bit of customizations. You can ask users to input a few words like name, action, etc and then it will modify the stories using your words.

#### Youtube Videos Downloader
Another interesting project is to make a nice interface through which you can download youtube videos in different formats and video quality.

#### Python Website Blocker
Build an application that can be used to block certain websites from opening. This is a very helpful program for students who want to focus on studies and don’t want any other distractions like social media.



### INTERMEDIATE

### Calculator in Python
Build a graphical user interface calculator using a library like Tkinter in which we build buttons to perform different operations and display results on the screen. You can further add functionalities for scientific calculations.

### Countdown Clock and Timer
You can build a desktop application of a countdown timer in which the user can set a timer and then when the time is completed, the app will notify the user that the time has ended. It’s a utility app for daily life tasks.

### Random Password Generator in Python
Creating a strong password is a tedious task. We can build an app to generate strong passwords randomly that contain alphabets, characters, and digits. The user can also copy the password so that they can directly paste it when creating the website.

### Random Wikipedia Article
The project is used to get a random article from Wikipedia and then we ask the user if he wants to read the article or not. If the answer is yes then we show the article otherwise we fetch another random article.

### Reddit Bot
 The Reddit is a great platform and we can program a bot to monitor subreddits. They can be automated to save a lot of our time and we can provide useful information to the Redditors.
 
### Python Command-Line Application
Python is great for building command-line applications. You can build a nice CLI interface through which you can send email to other people. It will ask the user for credentials and the data it needs to send and then we can send the data using a command line.

### Instagram Bot in Python
The Instagram bot project is made to automate some of the basic tasks like automatically liking, commenting or following people. The frequency must be low because sending excessive requests to Instagram servers might get you deactivated.

### Steganography in Python
Steganography is the art of hiding a message into another form such that no one can suspect the existence of the hidden message. For example, a message is hidden inside an image or a video. The project will be useful to hide messages inside the images.
